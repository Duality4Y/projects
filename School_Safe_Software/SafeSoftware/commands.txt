login <4 digit number>: login with de 4 digit number as pin
  when acces:
    1: set 5v line to low, and all other pins to ground
    0: tunrs 5v line HIGH and the other neccesary pins
    open: change servo to open state
    close: change servo to closed state
    sread: read servo value
    pread: read the pin code
    pin <4 digit number>: set the pin
    sleep: enter sleep mode
    logout: logout, basically set a boolean to false
    login <4 digit number>: login with de 4 digit number as pin
  no acces:
    message acces denied

Response commands:
#define BTOK 121 									//Needs to be unique, 150 = 66(B) + 84(T)
#define FALSE 42 									//Used when an operation/command failes
#define TRUE 1 										//Used when an operation/command succeeds
#define SERIAL_ACCES 2							 	//Used to say that the client/android/pc has acces
#define SERIAL_DENIED 3 							//Used to say that the client/android/pc has no acces
#define ROTARY_NORMAL 20 							//Used to state that the rotarys states is in normal/no rotation
#define ROTARY_LEFT 21 								//Used to state that the user is rotating the rotary to the left
#define ROTARY_RIGHT 22 							//Used to state that the user is rotating the rotary to the right
#define SEGMENT 8									//byte(1), byte(num0), byte(num1), byte(num2), byte(num3)
#define DISCONNECTED 4 								//Used to say to the client/android/pc that the user has been succesfully logged out
#define OPENED 5 									//Used to say that the safe is currently open
#define CLOSED 6									//Used to say that the safi is currently closed

usage of SEGMENT:
When the client receiver this command, it will use the 4 least significant bytes, as the pin, which is then split
in 4 separate digits to be shown on de seven segment displays on the GUI/android application
