gavrasm on DOS
--------------

If you get the error message "No DPMI" when trying to
start gavrasm.exe on a DOS machine, please download
the DOS package "Base files (program and units,
basego32.zip" (or the full package, if you like),
of Free Pascal from the website

   http://www.freepascal.org

Unpack the files and move the file "cwsdpmi.exe" to
a directory, which is in the path of your DOS.

This should resolve the problem. Unfortunately I
cannot verify this, because I don't have a DOS machine
here.

Remember: Using the DOS-version in a Win-Environment
requires that all filenames (e.g. of include files)
have to be compatible with the 8.3 format.
