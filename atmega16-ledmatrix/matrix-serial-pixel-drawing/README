the python script displaySerial.py
does the following:
with the m key you can toggle to display a cursor (where the mouse is on the screen)
onto the ledmatrix
the cursor will always be the inverse of the pixel it's sitting on.

holding the left mouse button draw pixels (turns them on)
and the right mouse button erases pixels (turns them off)

the i key inverses what you've draw.
the r key resets the display (turns all the pixels off)
the s key sets all the pixels on the display on.

the escape key and the x button close the application.

planned for making with what i learned with this python script.
are:

a snake game controlled with you mouse or the keyboard on the ledmatrix.
game of life simulation.
maybe pong ?
maybe fluid simulation ?
maybe a nbody sim ? (a simple on)
