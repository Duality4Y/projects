     3: ;	start working on implementing intterupts in assembly.
     4: ;	will make a walking light with interrupts timmers and leds.
     5: ;	note a rjmp(relative jump) can't jump as far as a jmp (jump)
     6: ;	but is faster, where jmp is slower.
     7: ;	rjmp can only jump 2047 up or down.
     8: ;	implementing timer interrupt and making it toggle a led.
     9: ;	timer works! going to main2.asm
    10: ;Edited 17 - 5 - 2014
    11: ;	timer interupt now correctly works.
    12: ;   my pin toggeling function wasen't right,
    13: ;	had to use in instead of ldi
    14: ;	
    15: ;	how to calculate
    16: ;	fcpu = 8000000
    17: ;	scale = 256
    18: ;	maxCValue = 2^16 (65536)-1
    19: ;	thus fcpu/scale/maxCValue = 0.47hz
    20: ;	to get 1hz we preload the timer on interupt with a value of
    21: ;	(2^16)/2 tcnt1 = 32768
    22: ;	and now the timer will tick once every second.
